* Homework 2 due next monday the 10th

* Definition REGULAR EXPRESSION: also known as RegEx or regexs, or RE
* every regualr expresssion describes a [REGULAR] langauge, which is a set of strings, so a regualr expression is a description of all strings in a set, and froom there the problem is pattern matching
* *matcehd strings are in the languague, where those unmatched are not

* {w | w contain substring 111} --> regular expresions offer a new way to describe something

* this implies that every regEx has an equivalent DFA, and because of that an equivalent NFA
